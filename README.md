# SlidingViewGC
The Sliding View GC algorithm was created in pursuance of a masters thesis 
around 1999 by Yossi Levanoni. This repository contains the original code 
and the PDF file of the thesis. The code was integrated into Sun's 
interpreter-based JVM of that time, and therefore may contain residual Sun
IP. Similarly, since the code was created for a thesis at the Technion, 
Israel's Institute of Technology, the Technion may have rights to the IP 
as well. The author (Yossi Levanoni) assumes no responsibility for usage 
incompatible with possible terms imposed by Sun (now Oracle) and/or the 
Technion. The author also assume no liability from any other unexpected 
consequences of reading or reusing this code.
